# SteamCompare

This is a tool to compare two users' steam games with two modes:
1. Quick Compare
  * This uses the results of /GetOwnedGames/ for both users and sees which ones they share
1. Full Compare
  * This grabs detailed information about each game and splits the results into three lists: Coop, Multiplayer, and Useless based on the Categories on the games

Dependencies:
* Requests
* PyMongo
* Flask
